# Star-Web

A web client for the Speech to Audio Relay system created by Sam Tupy.

# **NOTE**:

The code for this web app was converted from the original NVGT code using Chat GPT O1-preview. As such, there may be bugs that need to be resolved. Issue and pull request submitions are always welcome.

## Overview

This web client is similar in design to the NVGT user client, with a few notable exceptions:

* Rather than a config INI file, you must enter a server address and port on the page, then click the connect button
* When rendering a script in WAV, the web app will zip up the WAV files and open your browers download prompt

## How to Connect

If you don't want to host the web app yourself, you can go [here](https://dangero2000.github.io/Star-Web/) to access it instead. Once you reach the page, please type star.lidolp.net in the server address box, then 443 in the port box.
